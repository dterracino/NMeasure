NMeasure helps you to tackle your needs with regard to working with measurements: Numbers with Units.
It will help you to 
* convert measurements to other Units.
* compactify your units (well, your calculations result in the unit Kilogram*Meter / Second.Squared() ? That's Newton)
* The unit system is not hard-coded. There is a good set of commonly used physical units by instantiating the _StandardUnitConfiguration_
* NMeasure knows the concept of Fundamental units (e.g. Length and Time). While it will let you add 1 gram to 1 ton (if it knows the conversion), it won't let you add a second to a Joule.
* You can define your own Units and your own conversions, the configuration has its own
  Fluent API for you to just do that.

## Calculation ##

    using static NMeasure.U; //If you can use c#6, it imports common units.
    ...
    StandardUnitConfiguration.Use();
    ...
    var m1 = new Measure(2.0, Meter); // or 2m * Meter
    var m2 = new Measure(6.0, Second.Inverse());
    var m3 = m1*m2; // m3 is 12 meters / second;

Also use subtraction, addition and division.

## Conversion ##

    var m = new Measure(1.0, Kilometer);
    var m2 = m.ConvertTo(Millimeter);
    m2.Value.IsEqualTo(1000000);
    ...
    var t1 = 3 * Seconds;
    var t2 = 4 * Milliseconds;
    var t3 = t1 + t2 // Gives you 3.004 seconds, the first unit is carried over.

An example from the tests...

    AdHocConfig.Use(c=>
    {
        c.SetMeasurePrecision(2);
        c.Unit(Meter).IsPhysicalUnit(_LENGTH)
            .StartScale()
            .To(Kilometer, 1000);
        c.Unit(Second).IsPhysicalUnit(_TIME)
            .StartScale()
            .To(Hour, 3600);
    });
    var kmPerH = Kilometer / Hour;
    var mPerSec = Meter / Second;     
    var v1 = 100 * kmPerH;
    var v2 = v1.ConvertTo(mPerSec);
    v2.Unit.IsEqualTo(mPerSec);
    v2.Value.IsEqualTo(27.78m);
